Machine Learning Library for WOC
1. Linear Regression:
In linear regression, the RMSE value obtained is 74.76077433519104. The learning rate is 0.01 with 5000 iterations. 
2. Polynomial Regression:
The RMSE value obtained is 10.848025115526319. The learning rate is 0.01 with 1000 iterations. Squared and cubic terms are used in the hypothesis function. 
3. Logistic Regression:
The accuracy is 65%. The learning rate is 0.1 with 1000 iterations. The hypothesis function is linear in nature. 
4. KNN:
The value of k is 6, that is 6 nearest neighbours have been used for determining labels of the test data points. The accuracy obtained is 0.8366781539293195. or about 83%. 
5. K means map:
The accuarcy of K means map is about 25%. 
6. Neural Network: We have 2 neural networks, one with no hidden layer and another with one hidden layer.
